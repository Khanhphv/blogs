## PU8G: 8th Anniversary

Eight years ago, you took your first steps onto unfamiliar and unforgiving battlegrounds. Since that moment, every battle fought alongside you has become part of PUBG's legacy. The fierce struggles for survival, the exhilaration of victory, and the countless stories woven through camaraderie—all of it has led us to this moment of celebration.

This year, the battlegrounds shine brighter than ever. **Golden Grenades glisten in the heat of battle**, and the **8th Anniversary Bobble Bot** joins the festivities along with **towering billboards, dazzling fireworks,** and a **party ferry**. Excitement pulses through the battlegrounds, and the celebration is in full swing!

### Party on the Battlegrounds

※ The following updates apply to Normal Match and Ranked.

To celebrate our 8th anniversary, something massive and wobbly has appeared on the starting island... Before the match begins, try tossing a Golden Grenade at the Bobble Bot! When the total hits reach special milestones, the names of players who landed hits will be displayed on the billboard.

- Both the Bobble Bot and Golden Grenade are available on the starting island of every map.
- Fireworks will go off before the option to drop from the plane becomes available.
- Starting planes will also bear anniversary banners.

Erangel's ferry transforms into the festive 8th Anniversary Party Ferry, while two bridges and the docks are decorated in an 8th Anniversary theme.

### New Lobby Music

For PUBG's 8th anniversary, we teamed up with M83 to bring a special touch to our lobby music. Led by Anthony Gonzalez, M83 is renowned for their atmospheric, cinematic sound, with hits like _Midnight City_ and acclaimed film scores.
