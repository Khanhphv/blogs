Hello players!

Welcome to the third Store update of 2025.

March's Store update brings in a new **Survivor Pass**, a new **Progressive weapon skin and Chroma for the Mk12**, and the **Sisters of Sorcery collection**, and more!

### **Hideout Update**

Based on player feedback, **starting** **from** **Update 34.2**, the amount of materials obtained from salvaging Progressive weapon skins will scale with their level. Previously, salvaging a Progressive weapon skin provided a fixed amount of materials (Polymer x800, Schematic x3) regardless of its level. However, with Update 34.2, the materials obtained from salvaging will increase based on the Progressive weapon skin's level, as shown below.
