## **Gunplay Labs: Aim Punch 2**

Introducing the second round of Gunplay Labs: Aim Punch, featuring a refined aim punch system based on player feedback from Update 33.2.![](https://wstatic-prod-boc.krafton.com/common/news/20250310/sCYfyLec.jpg)

### Schedule (UTC)

- PC
  - March 12, after live server maintenance - March 26, 00:00
- Console
  - March 20, after live server maintenance - April 3, 01:00

### Details

- **Mode**: Intense Battle Royale
- **Perspective**: TPP Only
- **Party type**: Squad Only
- The types of Random Weapon Crates given at the start of the match are the following:
  - AR, SMG, DMR/SR, SG

***※*** ***Arcade Points will be granted for Gunplay Labs: Aim Punch 2 play sessions.***

### Aim Punch Adjustments

The aim punch system you experienced in Gunplay Labs: Aim Punch has been adjusted in Gunplay Labs: Aim Punch 2 as follows.

- We have reduced the dizziness caused by significant screen movement in the previous Gunplay Labs.
- For Aim Punch 2, we will implement a system where aim punch decreases with distance.
  - The aim punch of SMGs and shotguns decreases significantly with distance. At 50 meters, SMGs have similar aim punch to ARs.
  - SRs also experience a distance-based reduction in aim punch, but they still have a strong aim punch at mid-range.
  - ARs and DMRs have a marginally higher base aim punch than in the current game version, but beyond 100 meters, the aim punch decreases to levels comparable to the current game.
- In Gunplay Labs: Aim Punch 2, the VSS now has the same level of aim punch as SMGs.

*Dev's comment:* *In January, Gunplay Labs: Aim Punch introduced a new take on aim punch, and we received a lot of valuable feedback from players. After carefully reviewing your input and recognizing key concerns, we've decided to run a second round of Gunplay Labs focused on refining the system. In the upcoming Gunplay Labs: Aim Punch 2, you'll experience a more polished version of the aim punch mechanics. We've kept its core characteristics intact but made adjustments to reduce discomfort, such as dizziness effects. One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a distance-based aim punch reduction system, designed to create a more realistic experience. Additionally, based on feedback that testing new mechanics was challenging, Gunplay Labs: Aim Punch 2 will take place in Intense Battle Royale mode, ensuring more frequent engagements and better testing opportunities. After this session, we'll continue to analyze gameplay data and listen to your feedback to further evaluate the system. We appreciate your participation and look forward to hearing your thoughts!*
