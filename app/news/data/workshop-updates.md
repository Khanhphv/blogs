Hello players,

On **April 9, Update 35.1** will bring changes to the Workshop's Artisan Crafting and the Archivist's Chest. We're sharing the details in advance so you can review them before Update 35.1 goes live in April.

## Workshop Updates

### Artisan Crafting

With Update 35.1, 12 out of the 16 existing Artisan Crafting sets will no longer be available for purchase, except for the four sets listed below. However, the 12 discontinued sets may return in the future through periodic resales.

※ The four sets listed below will require re-registration in the system during the Update 35.1 maintenance. As a result, sale-ending notifications will be displayed for these four sets on the Artisan Crafting page, but **these sets will remain available for purchase after the update.**

※ **Additionally, after the re-registration, the following four sets will be displayed as craftable items even for players who already own them. Please keep this in mind.**

#### Items List

- Apocalypse Set
- Desert Enforcer Set
- Demon Thrall Set
- Demon Biker Set

### Archivist's Chest

In Update 35.1, the items obtainable from the Archivist's Chest will be upgraded. Further details will be provided at a later date. Additionally, after Update 35.1 maintenance is over, **the upgraded item pool will be applied to any unopened Archivist's Chests purchased before the update**.

Next, the list of Archivist's Chest bundles currently available in the Store will be updated as follows.

#### As-Is

- Archivist's Chest Bundle (x1)
- Archivist's Chest Bundle (x5)
- Archivist's Chest Bundle (x10)

#### To-Be

- Archivist's Chest Bundle (x1)
- Archivist's Chest Bundle (x10)
- Archivist's Chest Bundle (x25)
- Archivist's Chest Bundle (x50)

Thank you.
