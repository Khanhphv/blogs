Hello players!

The second DEV DROP is here, bringing you a new topic: Sanhok Destruction! Once again, Director Taehyun Kim shares honest answers to questions and feedback from players around the world.

While working on DEV DROP, we realized that many players have questions that aren't necessarily tied to a specific update. So, we thought—why not take this chance to answer some of those too?

That's why we've put together "Ask PUBG Anything"—a collection of answers to some of your burning questions that didn't make it into the video. Be sure to check it out after watching DEV DROP, and we hope you enjoy!

# Ask PUBG Anything

**Q.** Can you make it possible to set different weapon/Smoke Grenade/Pan skins for each preset?

**A.** We know our players have a variety of opinions on presets. We will carefully review feedback from the community and other sources to identify potential improvements.

**Q.**

- Can you add a feature to remove duplicate skins obtained from events?
- The issue of repeatedly receiving duplicate skins persists. Do you plan to continue releasing content that allows players to obtain duplicate skins?

**A.** We are fully aware of the issue with Event tier items, as they cannot be exchanged for BP or disassembled, making it difficult to manage them efficiently when they accumulate in the inventory. To address this, we plan to introduce a feature that allows players to remove Event tier items if they choose to.

**Q.** Some players have their Reputation levels lowered due to team kills or false reports when encountering a three-man squad engaging in unsportsmanlike behavior. Can you introduce improvements for such situations?

**A.** We are aware that players can become victims of team kills or false reports. We will discuss possible improvements internally to ensure fair players are not unjustly penalized due to others' misconduct.

**Q.** Are there any plans to address players who join matches via random squad matchmaking and go AFK to exploit events?

**A.** Please report such players under 'griefing or toxic behavior' with video evidence or relevant data. We will review the report and take appropriate actions.

**Q.** Do you have any plans to re-release past collaboration skins?

**A.** We are actively considering re-releasing previously launched collaboration skins. However, this is not a simple process, as collaborations require IP holder approvals and are subject to contractual limitations. Please share which IPs you'd like to see return in the community. Your feedback will help us prioritize the most requested collaborations.

**Q.** What is the timeline for implementing two-step authentication in the game? 

**A.** We have seen the ongoing feedback in the community regarding account security and the two-step authentication. To better protect our dedicated players, we are preparing to introduce this feature this year. We will share further details once the timeline is confirmed.

**Q.** When will the destruction mechanics be added to all maps?

**A.** The Destructible Terrain feature, first introduced in Rondo, will be gradually implemented in Taego, Miramar, and Erangel. As for the destructible buildings and objects introduced in Sanhok, there are still various factors to consider, such as performance issues and gameplay balance. We are carefully evaluating whether expanding this feature to other maps is the right decision.

**Q.** Is there a possibility of adding progressive costumes to the game?

**A.** We will be able to share more details about this when we release the 2025 roadmap soon.

**Q.** Question about the matchmaking system: Why are my teammates below level 100 when my Survivor Mastery Level is 2500?

**A.** The Survivor Mastery Level increases based on playtime and does not directly reflect player skill level. The matchmaking for Normal Match is based on MMR, which is calculated from various factors such as placement, kills, and other performance metrics in each match. We continuously update the MMR system to ensure it accurately reflects player skill. Please note that the MMR range among players tends to be narrower during peak hours and wider during off-peak hours.

**Q.** Can you add a search function for items? Please make it easier to find them.

**A.** We are not currently developing a search system based on item names, but we are working on a system with better filtering features to help players find items more efficiently. 

**Q.** The current system only allows reporting players for negative behavior. Will there be a feature to commend teammates or opponents for positive actions? Are there any plans for special interactive features?

**A.** The compliment feature was added to the live servers in July 2023. Players can commend their teammates using three types of compliments, and receiving positive feedback increases a player's Reputation level. You can find more details in the July 2023 Patch Notes (#24.2). However, since PUBG is a battle royale game where only one can be the last survivor, a system to praise opponents is not currently under consideration. 

**Q.** Will you add an immediate countermeasure against intentional team killers, such as preventing them from looting or moving?

**A.** Allowing players to immediately punish team killing could be exploited, making it an unviable option. However, we acknowledge ongoing player concerns about team kills and will continue to explore ways to address this issue. 

**Q.** Can you allow players to place multiple markers on the map? For example, allowing a player to set two or more markers would help teams coordinate better by highlighting multiple items and locations.

**A.** We will review potential improvements to the ping system.

**Q.** Why is there no longer a test server for game updates? Previously, early access on test servers helped identify issues in advance.

**A.** For a test server to be effective, it needs a substantial player base to ensure proper matchmaking. However, participation rates were low, making it difficult to gather meaningful feedback. Instead, we are using alternative methods, such as Labs in the Arcade, to showcase key features, engage in discussions with players, and gather more feedback before implementation.

**Q.** Why are there so many currencies in PUBG? Wouldn't it be good to only have a handful and not so many, as it can be very confusing?

**A.** We recognize that the variety of in-game currencies may be a barrier for players unfamiliar with PUBG's currency system. However, our goal is to provide diverse and enjoyable out-of-match experiences through the current system. While we have no plans to reduce the number of currencies, we are continuously exploring ways to improve the overall player experience.

**Q.** Why are you promoting TPP in Esports and don't stick to FPP like most of the other FPS games?

**A.** Both Ranked and Esports aim to provide competitive challenges for players. We have previously emphasized the importance of bridging the gap between playing and watching the game. While FPP has a dedicated fan base, TPP is still significantly more popular across all regions. Therefore, we are committed to delivering both an exciting viewing experience and competitive challenges for our TPP players as well. 

**Q.** Some ARs like the SCAR-L, Mk47 Mutant and M16A4 are weak compared to others, are you going to buff them?

**A.** We are preparing balance updates and meta adjustments this year, just like last year. Rather than focusing on individual weapons, we prioritize striking balance across weapon categories. A good example is the buffs we applied to SMGs last year to increase their viability. While we will continue refining the balance among individual weapons, our primary focus remains on ensuring balance across different weapon types.

**Q.** What are you going to do with the Thermal Scope? We provide feedback every week that the item is too strong and doesn't belong in PUBG.

**A.** We are fully aware of the feedback on the Thermal Scope, especially from the Western community. We have conducted extensive reviews and discussions, and details on changes to the Thermal Scope and other map-specific items will be shared in the upcoming roadmap. 

**Q.** Why is the Panzerfaust in Ranked/Esports? We provide feedback every week that the item belongs to casual games and not in a competitive setting?

**A.** We believe that aligning gameplay experiences across Normal Match, Ranked, and Esports is more important than ever. By actively incorporating diverse content from Normal Match into Ranked, we aim to reduce gameplay discrepancies and encourage more players to participate in Ranked and Esports. If balance adjustments are needed—such as changes to performance, spawn rates, or mechanics—we will actively consider player feedback, just as we previously adjusted the Panzerfaust’s firing mechanics. 

**Q.** Tell us more about PUBG and UE5. Will it be a separate game, or will the current version gradually evolve?

**A.** We will be sharing insights on PUBG's future development direction, including long-term plans, in the upcoming 2025 roadmap. Stay tuned! 

**Q.** Tell us about the fight against cheaters. Are you focusing more on banning cheaters or closing vulnerabilities to make cheating increasingly difficult?

**A.** We are actively addressing both aspects you mentioned. Our approach focuses on not only banning cheaters but also strengthening anti-cheat measures and closing security loopholes to stay ahead of rapidly evolving illegal software.

**Q.** Last year, there was an awesome collaboration with Automobili Lamborghini. Will there be similar collaborations this year, and if so, with whom?

**A.** We have exciting collaborations with premium automobile brands lined up for this year. Stay tuned for official announcements!
